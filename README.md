### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently building AI Agents to automate enterprises at [Reworkd (YC S23)](https://reworkd.ai/) in San Francisco, CA.

I've also worked as a Full Stack developer at Roku and HubSpot. I shipped developer tools to improve the Roku channel development experience and built custom banners for HubSpot customers to manage website cookie consent preferences. I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022 studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

Some of my favorite hobbies include hacking dev projects, working out, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
