### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently building AI Agents at [Reworkd](https://reworkd.ai/) in San Francisco, CA.

I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022 studying Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I've also worked as a Full Stack developer at Roku and HubSpot.

Some of my favorite hobbies include hacking dev projects, working out, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
