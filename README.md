### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently building AI Agents to automate enterprises at [Reworkd (YC S23)](https://reworkd.ai/) in San Francisco, CA.

I previously built [tools](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/resource-monitor.md) for channel developers at [Roku](https://www.roku.com/) and a [Cookie Consent Banner](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/privacy-and-consent/customize-your-cookie-tracking-settings-and-consent-banner) for 1,000+ SMBs at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/). I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022, studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

Some of my hobbies include hacking projects, working out, reading, playing 2k, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
