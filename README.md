### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently building AI Agents to automate enterprises at [Reworkd (YC S23)](https://reworkd.ai/) in San Francisco, CA.

I've also worked as a Full Stack developer at Roku and HubSpot. I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022, studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

Some of my favorite hobbies include hacking dev projects, working out, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
