### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently building [Pump.co](https://https://pump.co/), a platform that helps hundreds of startups cut their cloud spend by up to 60%.

I previously built AI Agents to extract structured data from the web at [Reworkd AI](https://reworkd.ai/). I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022, studying Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

My hobbies include hacking projects, working out, reading, playing 2k, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
